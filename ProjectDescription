At the moment I wanto to learn about NN, specially CNN. So I decided to create this project.
I took the data from Kaggel (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). There are about 4000 chet X-ray images, some of them are normal but others exibits bacteria o virus pneumonia. The task is classify them, 
as normal o pneumonia.
